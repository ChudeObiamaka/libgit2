This error is raised because the pkg-config is not available in your system
Steps to resolve the problem
Install PkgConfig using the package manager
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install pkg-config
PkgConfig tells the compiler where to find dependent libraries. Installing it with apt-get usually resolves the issue.

If GSSAPI is missing, Install the GSSAPI development package
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install libkrb5-dev
If the issue persists, ensure that the GSSAPI libraries and include files are in standard locations. You can check their locations using
dpkg -L libgssapi-dev
Make sure that the paths are included in the compiler and linker search paths

If OpenSSL is missing, Install the OpenSSL development package
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install libssl-dev
Installing libssl-dev provides the required OpenSSL libraries and headers.
You may also need to set the OpenSSL root directory path as a CMake variable. For example
cmake -DOPENSSL_ROOT_DIR=/usr/lib/ssl ..
